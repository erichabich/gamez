# Sole

##### WHAT

*Sole* is a minimal LESS framework\* and accompanying workflow tool\*\*

<small>\*a modified subset of [Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/), incl. resets, a grid system, a few utility classes, and readily customizable styles for typography, tables, forms and buttons</small>

<small>\*\*a style guide that demonstrates and documents the built CSS in-browser, alongside a livereload server that rebuilds the CSS and refreshes the style guide each time a LESS file is changed, without the need to manually execute the build process, restart the server or refresh the browser</small>

<br/>

##### HOW  

`git clone https://github.com/alexbasalyga/sole.git `  
`cd sole`  
`npm install`  
`npm start`

<br/>

##### REPO  

`./source/less`: contains only and all LESS files in this project  
`./source/less/sole.less`: main entry point of LESS source  
`./source/less/variables.less`: customize styles by adjusting these variables

<br/>

##### TODO
+ Finish porting style guide to jade
